1. Who am I and what is xbar?
	- @matryer: open source, author, @GoTimeFM podcast
	- xbar demo
2. Project structure
	- simple
	- monorepo contains everything: app front-end, app back-end, tools, website
3. Wails
	- xbar uses Wails by Lea Anthony
	- Wails is currently getting a v2 rewrite (which xbar uses)
	- build and package multi-platform desktop apps for Go https://wails.app
	- delivers a WebView, handles os calls, client and "server" RPC
4. Front-end
	- Svelte https://svelte.dev/ 
		- components contain markup, script, and style
		- does its work at compile time
		- very fast
	- Tailwind CSS
		- low-level CSS framework
		- fine tuned control
		- dark mode ;)
5. The Go Back-end
	- main.go just kicks off Wails app
	- app.Start callback
	- clearCache - function abstractions
	- *wails.Runtime object
	- Parsing plugin output
		- Great candidate for TDD
		- Processing strings
		- Fuzzing?
	- Turning the output into Wails menus
	- The Plugins service
	- Incoming URLs
6. xbarapp.com 
	- static site, generated by a custom tool
	- metadata extraction from GitHub repo
	- static API
